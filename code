  <p><i>Hola!</i></p>
  <p>Barcelona, is one of Spain's most populated, beautiful, and historic cities. Founded as a Roman Colony in 15 BC, 
     the city thrived under Roman rule; bustling with trade, it sure was a force to be reckoned with. Later, Barcelona under Muslim rule,
     but after Christian conquest, was governed by the Crown of Aragon. The rich history of Barcelona can only be <i>fully</i> experienced
     with our somewhat unconventional tours!</p>

  <p><i>Bonjour!</i></p>
  <p>Paris, the city of love, was founded towards the end of the 3rd century by the Gauls. Later, Julius Caesar and his legions
     built a settlement. Over centuries, the French developed their own governance - a long monarchial system. The regality of 
     French history can be seen from the historic cities of Paris and Versailles to the countryland of Bordeaux. The rich history of

  <p><i>こんにちは!</i></p>
  <p>Tokyo, the capital of the "Land of the Rising Sun", shines as brightly as the sun in our list of must-see places. The story of Tokyo begins some 400 years ago.
     The city was originally named Edo, similar to one of the greatest periods in Japanese history - the Edo Period: The last period of isolationist Japan where the 
     country was still able to be economically, politically, and socially indepedent. During the Edo Period, the Emperor moved his capital from Kyoto to Tokyo; since then, 
     Tokyo has become the powerhouse of Japan. The rich history of Toky can only be <i>fully</i> experienced with our somewhat unconventional tours!</p>
